# IipuAngular (Imgix Image Processor UI in Angular)

  This project is an Angular web app that consumes Imgix's API, developed with Angular Material. It exposes many important transformations and features to make it easy to have variations on a base image or to be able to apply different types of optimizations to images.

  Here you can test each of the features that this API has, generating a new image through parameters in real time.

## How it works

You can choose an image from the test images available to apply different transformations.
The edition tools can be seen by clicking the "Start editing" button in the toolbar.
A list will appear on the left side showcasting all the transformation features available for you to select. Once you select one, the input will appear under the main image, so you can apply the desired transformation.

Several transformations can be applied at the same time and will be displayed as different tags in a box next to the main image.

You will be able to:
- Modify your current applied edition by selecting it on the left list and setting another value.
- Remove one or more editions simply by pressing the "x" on the tags displayed inside the "Editions apllied" box.
- Undo and Redo, with the two buttons on the toolsbar's right side.
- Change the selected image at any time, and all the previous transformations will be applied to the new image.
- Once you are done, you can copy the URL (right below the main image) which will take you to your image with all the transformations applied at the moment.
- You can go to my LinkedIn profile clicking the button on right corner of the toolbar
